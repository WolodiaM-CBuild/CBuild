 - Static scratch field in hash class for map of file_path-file_hash
 - Map of hashes from hash files
 - Load cpp file
 	- Strip comments
	- Load list of needed headers
	- Get hash
	- Store hash of file in map
	- Iterate over list of headers and if in map - skip, else:
		- Load hpp file
		- Strip comments
		- Get hash
		- Store hash in map
	- Check if cpp hash match and if all hpp hashes match, if something not - add file for recompilation
- Use not-deprecased function from OpenSSL!



DONE:
	New hash algoritm, not depend on OpenSSL!
	Get hash of file content without comments and get includes from file.
	Save absolute pathes for files with connection to hashes
TODO:
	Second pass of heshes, to get hash of headers, use map_new::get != NULL to check if we not hash this header already
	Save headers in connection to file!
	Check hash differenbce and return file list
