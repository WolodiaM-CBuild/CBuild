 - Static scratch field in hash class for map of file_path-file_hash
 - Map of hashes from hash files
 - Load cpp file
 	- Strip comments
	- Load list of needed headers
	- Get hash
	- Store hash of file in map
	- Iterate over list of headers and if in map - skip, else:
		- Load hpp file
		- Strip comments
		- Get hash
		- Store hash in map
	- Check if cpp hash match and if all hpp hashes match, if something not - add file for recompilation
- Use not-deprecased function from OpenSSL!
